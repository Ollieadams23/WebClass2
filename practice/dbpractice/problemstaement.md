# Local Attractions Guide for Tourists

## Problem Statement

Tourists visiting a new city often struggle to discover local attractions, hidden gems, and experiences that are not well-represented in traditional guidebooks or online reviews. This lack of information can lead to a less-than-ideal travel experience, missed opportunities, and a failure to fully appreciate the local culture.

## Goals

1. Provide tourists with a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to local attractions, including popular spots, hidden gems, and off-the-beaten-path experiences.
2. Offer personalized recommendations based on individual interests, preferences, and location.
3. Facilitate easy discovery and navigation to attractions, including directions, opening hours, and contact information.
4. Enhance the overall tourist experience by providing insider knowledge and tips from locals.

## Target Audience

* Tourists visiting a new city for leisure or business
* Travelers seeking unique and authentic experiences
* Locals looking to explore their own city or recommend attractions to visitors

## Key Features

* Interactive map view of local attractions
* Search and filtering by category, location, and rating
* Personalized recommendations based on user preferences
* Detailed attraction profiles, including photos, reviews, and practical information
* Integration with popular review platforms and social media
* Offline access for areas with limited internet connectivity

## Success Metrics

* User engagement and retention
* Number of attractions discovered and visited
* User satisfaction and ratings
* Revenue generated through affiliate partnerships or in-app purchases
